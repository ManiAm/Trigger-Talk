# Trigger-Talk

This project enables passive voice activation using offline hotword detection. This component continuously listens for predefined trigger phrases and activates downstream actions when a match is detected. An ideal hotword engine runs efficiently for extended periods with minimal CPU usage, supports low-latency detection, operates offline, and maintains high accuracy across varying accents and background noise conditions.

In the [Speak-IO](https://github.com/ManiAm/Speak-IO) project, hotword detection can be used to trigger the start of recording or transcription automatically, reducing the need for manual interaction like clicking a "Start" button. This makes the experience more natural, especially in hands-free or accessibility-focused scenarios.

## Hotword Detection

Hotword detection - also known as "wake word" detection - is a specialized speech processing technique used to identify a specific keyword or phrase (like "Hey Siri" "OK Google" or "Alexa") within a continuous audio stream. When the hotword is detected, the system transitions from a passive or low-power state into an active listening mode, ready to process full user commands or begin full transcription.

Although it is not full speech-to-text, hotword detection can be considered a lightweight, task-specific form of speech recognition with stricter constraints. It is designed to operate with:

- Low latency for instant responsiveness
- High accuracy, even across accents and noise
- Low computational footprint, suitable for edge devices
- Always-on capability, often running continuously in the background
- Offline operation, to preserve privacy and reduce reliance on cloud APIs

This design makes hotword detection especially valuable in voice-enabled applications where continuous transcription would be computationally expensive, power-intensive, or privacy-sensitive. By filtering for specific trigger phrases, hotword detectors enable efficient and intentional user engagement in smart assistants, mobile apps, automotive systems, and IoT devices.

## Techniques

There are several methods to implement hotword detection, with varying trade-offs in accuracy, latency, resource usage, and customizability.

- **Pattern Matching-Based Detection**: This approach uses traditional signal processing techniques to continuously analyze the audio stream for acoustic patterns that match a predefined keyword. Features such as MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) are extracted and compared against a stored template using statistical models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or rule-based matching. Itâ€™s lightweight and fast, making it suitable for simple or embedded systems, but often lacks robustness in noisy environments or with different speaker accents. Examples: PocketSphinx, early Kaldi-based systems, [Vosk](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api).

- **Transcription-Based Keyword Spotting**: This method uses a speech-to-text system to transcribe the incoming audio stream in real time or near real time. The resulting text is then scanned for the presence of keywords using exact, fuzzy, or semantic matching. It offers the highest flexibility (supporting arbitrary phrases without retraining) but tends to be more resource-intensive and has higher latency compared to dedicated hotword detectors. Examples: OpenAI Whisper, faster-whisper.

- **Per-Keyword Acoustic Modeling**: This method trains a separate acoustic model specifically for each hotword, often using a small set of user-provided audio samples. The system learns to distinguish the hotword from background noise and other speech patterns using models like GMMs or small neural networks. It allows for customizable, offline hotword detection with relatively low resource usage, but typically requires manual training and does not scale well to many keywords. Examples: [Snowboy](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy).

- **General-Purpose Neural Network Detection**: This approach employs a single, compact neural network trained to recognize one or more predefined hotwords across different speakers and environments. Rather than requiring separate training for each keyword, it uses compiled acoustic representations to match keywords efficiently in real time. These models are highly accurate, low-latency, and well-suited for deployment on mobile or embedded platforms. Examples: [Porcupine](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine).

## Getting Started

From the project root directory, build the project using the following command:

    docker compose build

Once the build completes, launch the container in the background:

    docker compose up -d

You can check the container status using:

    docker compose ps
    docker logs -f hotword

These URLs provide access to hotword detection service:

- Swagger API docs: http://localhost:5600/api/docs
- API Base URL: http://localhost:5600/api/hotword/

## Hotword Detection Client

The hotword service exposes a WebSocket-based interface that [clients](client.py) can connect to. Upon connection, the client must initialize hotword detection by sending a JSON object with relevant parameters. Here is an example where the client is asking to use Vosk for hotword detection and OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text.

    params = {
        "dev_index": None,                               # Audio input device index (None = default)
        "hotwords": ["hey jarvis", "hey agent"],         # List of trigger phrases to activate STT
        "model_engine_hotword": "vosk",                  # hotword detection engine to use
        "model_name_hotword": "vosk-model-en-us-0.22",   # Name of the specific model to load
        "model_engine_stt": "openai_whisper",            # STT engine to use
        "model_name_stt": "small.en",                    # Name of the specific model to load
        "target_latency": 100,                           # Desired processing latency (in milliseconds)
        "silence_duration": 3                            # Duration of silence (in seconds) to stop recording
    }

Once initialized, the hotword service actively listens for any of the specified hotwords. When a hotword is detected, the service notifies the client through the WebSocket connection. It then enters a full recording mode, capturing the user's speech until silence is detected. The `silence_duration` parameter allows clients to control how long the service should detect silence (in seconds) before it considers the speech session complete. After recording, the audio is sent to the STT engine for transcription. Once the transcription is complete, the final transcribed text is sent back to the client.

This project supports [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord). It is an open-source hotword detection engine built for flexibility and local-first operation. It leverages lightweight TensorFlow Lite models optimized for edge devices, and supports loading multiple wakewords simultaneously. It requires no cloud connectivity or API key, making it ideal for privacy-conscious applications and offline environments. Out of the box, OpenWakeWord gives you access to the following [pre-trained](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord#pre-trained-models) wakewords:

    "alexa", "hey mycroft", "hey jarvis", "hey rhasspy", "timer", "weather"

You can train [your own](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord?tab=readme-ov-file#training-new-models) `.tflite` models without needing deep machine learning expertise.

This project also supports Picovoice [Porcupine](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine). It is a commercial hotword detection engine known for its high accuracy, low latency, and minimal resource usage. To use Porcupine, you must obtain a free access key from Picovoice. Out of the box, Porcupine gives you access to the following pre-trained wakewords:

    "view glass", "smart mirror", "bumblebee", "ok google", "grasshopper",
